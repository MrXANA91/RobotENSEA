# Robot ENSEA : projet 2A

This project consists in the creation of a semi-autonomous robot which will be able to do exploration in a hostile area, that is to say a hard place to get to or a dangerous zone to human.
Once completed, it will be possible to connect to the robot via Wi-Fi and control it from a web page. On this page, it will be possible to guide the robot, see thanks to a camera the environment in which itâ€™s evolving. Moreover, we will also have information on the atmospheric pressure, the concentration of carbon monoxide, the temperature of the place it is in thanks to sensors on it.
The goal of this robot is to allow the exploration of dangerous areas to humans. For example, in case of gas leak, our robot would be able to move itself in the middle of the toxic area to give more information about the gravity of the leak or maybe find the cause thanks to the camera that could indicate the pierced pipeline. The camera could also spot persons in danger in the area.
Furthermore, our robot could evolve on its own, using instructions previously given to it by the operator. The robot could save any data it can gather from its environment, for an afterward analysis by the human operator.
In conclusion, this project has the goal to create a robot capable of moving, gathering information of all kind about an area, either alone or controlled by an operator. It will assist the human in intelligence tasks, especially in dangerous areas that are only accessible by it.
